        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Pizza is a deliciously savory dish that combines tender, flavorful chicken with a crisp pizza crust,
            topped with a variety of cheeses and vibrant toppings. The recipe begins by preparing or purchasing a pizza
            dough, which is rolled out and topped with a rich tomato or barbecue sauce as the base. The chicken is
            seasoned with Italian herbs, garlic, salt, and pepper, then either grilled or pan-cooked until tender and
            juicy. Once cooked, the chicken pieces are evenly spread across the sauce-covered crust.</p>
        <p>Additional toppings such as sliced bell peppers, onions, olives, and sometimes mushrooms are layered on top,
            adding a mix of textures and flavors. The pizza is generously topped with shredded mozzarella or a blend of
            cheeses, then baked in a hot oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Garnished
            with fresh basil or parsley, chicken pizza is a delightful dish perfect for gatherings or a cozy night in,
            enjoyed best with a sprinkle of chili flakes or oregano.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Dough:</strong> Mix flour, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil, and warm water to form a soft

            <li><strong>Cook chicken:</strong> Season chicken with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
                Grill or pan-cook until fully cooked, then slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll Dough:</strong> Preheat the oven. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired
                thickness and place it on a pizza pan.

            <li><strong>Add Sauce and Toppings:</strong> Spread pizza sauce over the dough. Layer with cooked chicken,
