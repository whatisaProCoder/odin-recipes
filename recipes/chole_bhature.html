    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish that combines spicy chickpea curry (chole) with deep-fried bread
        (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked in a rich, spiced tomato-based sauce with ingredients like onions, ginger,
        garlic, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. Often simmered until the
        flavors are deeply infused, the chole is tangy and slightly spicy, with an optional dash of amchur (dry mango
        powder) or lemon juice for an extra tang. It is typically garnished with fresh coriander, onions, and green
        chilies, adding both flavor and a touch of color.</p>
    <p>The bhature is made from a dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a bit of baking powder, kneaded and left to
        rest before being rolled out and deep-fried. When fried, these fluffy and golden-brown breads puff up, creating
        a soft, pillowy texture that pairs perfectly with the chole’s spicy flavors. Chole Bhature is often served with
        a side of pickles, sliced onions, and sometimes a cooling yogurt-based raita. This hearty, indulgent meal is a
        favorite for breakfasts, festive occasions, or weekend treats across India.</p>
