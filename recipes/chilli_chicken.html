        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chilli Chicken is a popular Indo-Chinese dish known for its spicy, savory flavors and crispy texture.
            Boneless chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, ginger-garlic paste, and spices, then
            coated in a light batter of cornflour and flour. The marinated chicken is deep-fried until golden and
            crispy, giving it a satisfying crunch that forms the base of the dish. The chicken is then set aside while
            preparing a flavorful sauce made from soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, and garlic.</p>
        <p>In the next step, onions, bell peppers, and green chilies are stir-fried with garlic in hot oil until
            slightly softened, adding color and crunch to the dish. The fried chicken pieces are tossed into the pan,
            coated in the spicy sauce, and mixed well with the vegetables. This creates a harmonious balance of flavors
            and textures, with tender, spicy chicken and crisp veggies. Garnished with chopped green onions, chilli
            chicken can be served as an appetizer or as a main dish with fried rice or noodles, making it a favorite for
            those who enjoy bold, spicy flavors.</p>
